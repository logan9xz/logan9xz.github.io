			<p> Your time tells you ever thing it shows you your rank it shows you do you have higher times than other people.</p>
			<p> It also showes you your rank time over the event that you do.</p>
			<p> I mean by this is so you run the 1600 event and you want to practice it when you are done you put down your time for ever time you run so you can see if your time is getting faster or slower.</p>
			<p> yoyu can also put down your time for each lap so you can see how fast or slower you get each lap.</p>
